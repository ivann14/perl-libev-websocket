This folder contains two performance tests that can be used for benchmarking your application.

GenerateAsManyActiveClientsAsPossible.yml can tell you how many users per second can you accept by your application during the ordinary traffic and clients activity.

GenerateAsManyNonActiveClientsAsPossible.yml can tel you how many users can your application accept. And then the latency of the server's response.
